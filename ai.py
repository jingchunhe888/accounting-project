        prompt = f'''
        You are an accountant. Your task is to extract and simplify the vendor/payee name from the given transaction description, ensuring it is suitable for accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero.

        Instructions:

        Simplify the Vendor/Payee Name: Remove very obvious random unecessary characters like store numbers and locations or reciept numbers for example, Duane Reade 293 woefhx234 should be Duane Reade. If a number is part of the company name, keep it. For example 72 French Cleaners or Tha72. Ensure the name is in title case, with each word starting with an uppercase letter and the rest in lowercase.
        
        Transaction Types:
        If some words are cut short, of if there are abbreviations, write it out. For example, Locksmi is Locksmith, and Mktpl is Marketplace.
        1. Bank or Credit Card Transactions: If the transaction is between bank accounts or credit cards, keep the account or credit card number intact.
        2. Company vs. Person: Distinguish between companies and people. For example, if the description is "Payment from John Doe," return "John Doe." If the description is "From Lucie Inc.," return "From Lucie Inc."
                Usually there might be the location of the company at the end. A location, like New York or Nassau cannot be the name of the vendor/payee.

        3. Company Names:
        Core Name: Remove any suffix indicating business type (e.g., Inc, Ltd). Keep only the core company name.
        Branches and Products: Retain branch or product names, like "Microsoft Azure," but unify variations of the same parent company. For instance, "Microsoft Redmond" and "Nnt Microsoft" should both return "Microsoft," while "Nnt Msft Azure" should return "Microsoft Azure."
        4. Special Characters: Ignore URL fragments like "www" or "com" that may have been converted to text.
        
        Output: Return only the simplified vendor/payee name with no additional text.
